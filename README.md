# UsageAccessBug
It's created to demo the problem about Usage Access Settings for Wearable.

The problem: I want to open settings screen for my app, as in the mobile app version. However in the Wear OS, it can't open my app's specific usage permission screen.

Here is the expected behavior from Mobile Device
